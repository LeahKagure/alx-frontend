0. **Fix the hero banner** - Because we did some changes with the `article.html` page in the previous project, our hero banner background is no more visible. Let's fix it!
1. **Make the container flexible** - Using the previous file as the base, in your `02-styles.css` file update the `.container` selector by changing `width` to `max-width`. If you resize your browser, you should see that the content is resizing
2. **Fix layout issues** - Whatever the browser you use, it's a good idea from now on, to `toggle the device view`
3. **Generate images with responsive breakpoints** - Go to *Responsive Breakpoints* and change the provided settings
4. **Create the mobile icon and hide the menu** - We want to have a clickable icon that shows and hide our navigation. We don't want to use JavaScript but find a pure HTML/CSS way. Use the previous files as the base for this project and perform the given instructions
5. **Hamburger!** - Let's now, use a little bit of CSS magic to create an "hamburger" icon just with CSS
6. **Add the behavior based on menu-btn state** - Follow the provided instructions to work on `06-index.html` and `06-styles.css`
7. **Make the font size responsive** - This is a simple way to achieve responsive typography. More complex options can also be used to have a more granular control over the font sizes
8. **Improve the "Works" section** - Using the given instructions, work on `08-index.html` and `08-styles.css`
9. **Improve the "Footer" section** - Use the given instructions to work on `09-styles.css`, in the `/* Footer` section
10. **Fix the top header background** - In `10-index.html`, in the `body` tag, add the class `article-page`. In `10-styles.css`, in the `/* Section HERO` section, just before the media query, carry out the provided instructions
11. **Make the article page responsive** - Use the `article.html` for the task for `100-styles.css`
